\begin{abstract}
We show that the local observables of the curved $\beta\gamma$ system
encode the sheaf of chiral differential operators using the machinery of \cite{CG}, 
which combines renormalization, the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, and factorization algebras. 
Our approach is in the spirit of deformation quantization via Gelfand-Kazhdan formal geometry.
We begin by constructing a quantization of the $\beta\gamma$ system with an $n$-dimensional formal disk as the target. There is an obstruction to quantizing equivariantly with respect to the action of formal vector fields $\Vect$ on the target disk, and it is naturally identified with the first Pontryagin class in Gelfand-Fuks cohomology.
Any trivialization of the obstruction cocycle thus yields an equivariant quantization with respect to an extension of $\Vect$ by $\hOmega^2_{cl}$, the closed 2-forms on the disk. By results in \cite{CG}, we then naturally obtain a factorization algebra of quantum observables, which has an associated vertex algebra easily identified with the formal $\beta\gamma$ vertex algebra. Next, we introduce a version of Gelfand-Kazhdan formal geometry suitable for factorization algebras, and we verify that for a complex manifold $X$ with trivialized first Pontryagin class, the associated factorization algebra recovers the vertex algebra of CDOs of~$X$.\\
